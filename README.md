# 🏭 Warehouse Robo: Pathfinding with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

A reinforcement learning project implementing **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for autonomous pathfinding and obstacle avoidance in warehouse environments. The agent learns to navigate a **10×10 warehouse grid**, efficiently reaching target locations while avoiding collisions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Warehouse Robo simulates an intelligent agent trained using Deep Q-Learning to solve navigation tasks in a warehouse-like environment. The system demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning for automating warehouse logistics.
